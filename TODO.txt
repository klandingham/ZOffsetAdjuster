TODO:

- Before doing anything, script should obtain current value of Z-offset and restore it if user aborts
- Needs general clean up of code.
- Still want to make an installable package for this, so it will run on any Windows machine regardless
  of whether or not Python is installed.
- Add behavior when printer can't be found or is found but can't be opened (e.g., another app using
  the port).
- (Maybe) Add bed X,Y dimensions to the config file and use those.
