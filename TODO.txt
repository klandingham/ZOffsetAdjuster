TODO:

- After testing, decided the interface to adjust increment is cumbersome. Almost always want to fine
  tune the offset with .01 increments after adjusting with 0.1 increments. So I'm going to add an 'f'
  command for "fine-tune". Making it a toggle.
:w

- Needs general clean up of code.

- Still want to make an installable package for this, so it will run on any Windows machine regardless
  of whether Python is installed.

- (Maybe) Add bed X,Y dimensions to the config file and use those.
