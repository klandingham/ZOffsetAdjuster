TODO:

1. Logic not finished yet, measurement method is close, but not quite done.
2. Need to add ending code to finish command sequence (store offset, restore endstops, etc).
3. Interaction within PyCharm seems OK, but when run from command prompt, print's are getting buffered.
   Sometimes the output appears too late.
4. Needs general clean up of code.
5. Still want to make an installable package for this, so it will run on any Windows machine regardless
   of whether or not Python is installed.
