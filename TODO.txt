TODO:

- When program starts, temp reporting should be disabled. When preheating, it should be enabled,
  then disabled. On script exit, it should be enabled. This should help with response processing.

- Before doing anything, script should obtain current value of Z-offset and restore it if user aborts

- Needs general clean up of code.

- Still want to make an installable package for this, so it will run on any Windows machine regardless
  of whether Python is installed.

- Add behavior when printer can't be found or is found but can't be opened (e.g., another app using
  the port).

- (Maybe) Add bed X,Y dimensions to the config file and use those.
